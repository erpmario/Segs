There are other colors for even stronger or weaker enemies.<br><br>There are also three different types of enemies at each level, these are <color #ffff00>Minions</color>, <color #ff9900>Lieutenants</color>, and <color #ff0000>Bosses</color>. <color #ffff00>Minions</color> are the weakest and you should be able to defeat these easily. <color #ff9900>Lieutenants</color> are stronger, and have more attacks and can take more damage. Finally <color #ff0000>Bosses</color> are the strongest, and even if a Boss 'cons' green to you, you are in for a tough fight.<br><br>Now go see Lt. MacReady and learn about how to deal with your foes.
